{"name":"Spatial-sbml","tagline":"libraries & tools for spatial simulation of SBML models","body":"# Spatial SBML\r\nThis project contains a library, as well as a front end application for spatial simulation of SBML Models (using [SBML Level 3](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications) with the [Spatial package](http://sbml.org/Community/Wiki/SBML_Level_3_Proposals/Spatial_Geometries_and_Spatial_Processes \"Spatial package\") ). This project is made possible in cooperation with the [Funahashi Lab](http://fun.bio.keio.ac.jp/) who developed the simulator. (The initial presentation from COMBINE 2011 can still be found online [here](http://co.mbine.org/events/COMBINE_2011/agenda?q=system/files/2011-09-04-combine-funahashi-spatial-simulator.pdf).) \r\n\r\n## How to build\r\nThis project uses CMake, as such building ought to be as easy as running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir build  \r\ncd build  \r\ncmake -DBUILD_UI=ON <directory with sources>  \r\nmake  \r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running the GUI\r\nOnce installed, simply double click SpatialUI, and the following interface will come up.   \r\n\r\n![SpatialUI, the interface](https://raw.github.com/fbergmann/spatial-sbml/master/screenshots/2012-06-12_fish300x300.png)\r\n\r\nFrom here, you could simply open one of the example models supplied. We use a custom annotation to store settings such as the last selected species, the colors used for them as well as the bounds. Of course you can open any model in the SBML Spatial format and define these settings yourself: \r\n\r\n- **Selecting the variables to plot**: from the *Palette Assignment* panel, simply select the Species to display, choose one of the palettes distributed with the program, and define the maximum concentration (will be used to scale the palette). Next click 'add'. While it is possible to add multiple species that way I recommend to choose < 3 (and those in the palettes 'black-red', 'black-green' and 'black-blue' as that maps best to the RGB color scheme. \r\n- **Displaying Concentrations at a certain point**: Simply click on a coordinate, and concentrations for all selected species will be displayed. \r\n- **Modifying the concentrations at a coordinate**: First select the species whose concentrations you would like to change, next specify the concentration and enable the 'Apply' button. Then simply click / drag the mouse along the canvas to change the concentrations at those points. \r\n\r\nShould you have further questions, or concerns please let me know. \r\n## SpatialSBML API \r\nI'm currently in the process of exposing the API through SWIG. A first prototype is available in the examples folder. To test it, compile with with the CMake option `WITH_JAVA=ON`, and then modify the example in `examples/bindings` to adjust the location of the sample file.  \r\n\r\nThe API consists of these functions: \r\n\r\n* SpatialSimulator ()\r\n* virtual ~SpatialSimulator ()\r\n* void initFromFile (const std::string &fileName, int xdim, int ydim, int zdim=1)\r\n* void initFromString (const std::string &sbml, int xdim, int ydim, int zdim=1)\r\n* void run (double endTime, double step)\r\n* double oneStep (double initialTime, double step)\r\n* void setParameterUniformly (const std::string &id, double value)\r\n* void setParameter (const std::string &id, double value)\r\n* int getXDim () const \r\n* int getYDim () const \r\n* int getZDim () const \r\n* double getVariableAt (const std::string &id, int x, int y, int z=0)\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm also exposing these functions that I'm not happy about as they reveal too much about the underlying implementation. In addition they are not wrapped by the language bindings: \r\n\r\n* SpatialSimulator (SBMLDocument *doc, int xdim, int ydim, int zdim=1)\r\n* void initFromModel (SBMLDocument *doc, int xdim, int ydim, int zdim=1)\r\n* const Model * getModel () const \r\n* int getIndexForPosition (double x, double y)\r\n* int getVariableLength () const \r\n* int getGeometryLength () const \r\n* void setParameterUniformly (variableInfo *info, double value)\r\n* double * getVariable (const std::string &id, int &length)\r\n* double * getGeometry (const std::string &id, int &length)\r\n* boundaryType * getBoundaryType (const std::string &id, int &length)\r\n* int * getBoundary (const std::string &id, int &length)\r\n* double * getX (int &length)\r\n* double * getY (int &length)\r\n* double * getZ (int &length)\r\n* void setGnuplotExecutable (const std::string &location)\r\n* const std::string & getGnuplotExecutable () const \r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\nThis project requires the following libraries: \r\n\r\n- [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) along with a supported xml library (xml2, expat, xerces-c)\r\n- [Qt4](http://qt-project.org/) for the frontend\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis project is licensed under the BSD license: \r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, Frank T.
